**This is a simple simulation of Conway's "Game of Life"!**<br/><br/>
Implemented using Java Swing for CSCI 235: Programming Languages.<br/>
Several features implemented:
- Pausing/Resuming the game
- Manual editing of the grid via clicking
- Changing the speed of animation on-the-go (does not affect FPS)
- Option to simulate the game on a toroidal array (making the edges "stitched")
